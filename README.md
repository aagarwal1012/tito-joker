## A humorous AI that uses state-of-the-art deepÂ learning to tell jokes

**Tito Joker** aims to understand humor well enough to tell jokes that are actually funny. All you have to do is input a riddle type question and he tells a joke using it. He still has a long way to go but we will get there!

## Methodology

### Architecture
Fine-tuned version of the recently released [OpenAI GPT-2 model](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/) with a left-to-right language modeling training objective. Similar hyperparameters were used from the [original paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf).

### Data
A [jokes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes) from Kaggle was used for fine-tuning. Aside from the original preprocessing, additional special tokens were added to allow the model to understand the difference between the "question" and "answer" components of a riddle type joke.

*Warning: the dataset contains NSFW jokes, so Tito Joker's humour will also reflect jokes of this nature.*

Special thanks to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for their implementation of OpenAI GPT-2 using PyTorch, [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for making it super easy to deploy Tito Joker as a webapp, and [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/) for sponsoring the server that I am running Tito Joker on.

## About

**Why is the AI named Tito Joker?** Because in Filipino, "tito" means "uncle" when translated to English, and in the Philippines, we all have that uncle who says the corniest jokes!
